# MeasurementError_RRT

This repository contains the Python and R code for the paper "Accounting for Measurement Error and Untruthfulness in Binary RRT Models".

The Python code simulates data from two basic RRT models and one comprehensive model. The R code estimates the odds ratio for predictability for each model.

The abstract of the paper is provided below:

This study examines the effect of measurement error on binary Randomized Response Technique models. We discuss a method for estimating and accounting for measurement error and untruthfulness in two basic models and one comprehensive model. Both theoretical and empirical results show that not accounting for measurement error leads to inaccurate estimates. We introduce estimators that account for the effect of measurement error. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure of model privacy using an odds ratio statistic which offers better interpretability than traditional methods.
